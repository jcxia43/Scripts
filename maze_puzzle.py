# solution : Breadth-First Search
# The total idea is making every status a tuple ( No. status, operation, value), which is a 
# basic element in a path. A path is a combination of amount of choices of status, of which 
# length is related to current depth the program goes. Paths list is a collection of all 
# possible paths under current depth. Cutting branches is extremely important for improve 
# the efficiency of this script.
